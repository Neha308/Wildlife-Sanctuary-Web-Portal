	<p><b>What is a National Park?</b><br><br>

<b>A National Park is a natural space that is dedicated for the purposes of conservation, recreation, and protection. Different countries have their own national parks and the designation of national parks across the globe depends on each individual country’s system and judgment. But most national parks have similar aims – to conserve wild nature in order to protect it for the future as well as allow people the chance to enjoy it. National parks are often a symbol of national pride. Most national parks are open to the public and provide opportunities for recreation, camping, and walking. Most national parks have an outstanding level of natural beauty, whether the beauty comes from mountains, lakes, rivers or plains.</b></p><br><br>

<p><b>What is a Wildlife Sanctuary?</b><br><br>


<b>Animal sanctuaries exist for many specific reasons, but the overriding reason is to help protect animals and safeguard their lives. Animal sanctuaries give new homes to abandoned animals and animals rescued from dangerous conditions, help to protect animals from illegal activities, and serve as places where endangered animals breed and are therefore protected. Animals in animal sanctuaries cannot be responsibly returned to their natural habitats as they are not fit enough for the wild, or their habitat has been destroyed. A sanctuary is a haven, a place where animals can be protected.</b></p><br><br>


<p><b>Visitors to National Parks</b><br><br>


<b>National parks are increasingly popular around the world. They attract visitors not just from the inside the country but internationally – many people travel to a certain country with the specific intention of visiting their National Parks. Therefore, these parks and sanctuaries are very important for tourism.
For example, in the United States In 2016, 330,971,689 people visited National Parks, according to the National Park Service website. The most-visited national park in the US was the Great Smoky Mountains NP, followed by the Grand Canyon NP and Rocky Mountain NP. In the UK, 4.15 million people visited the Brecon Beacons National Park in 2014.

If you are planning a dream trip to a national park outside your own country you’ll need expert travel insurance to cover the cost of any unexpected illness, accident and/or evacuation.</b></p><br><br>
